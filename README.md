## Github Profile Clone
Challenge: Create a clone of the github repositories page using the github API  
Challenge 2: Allow users to search and filter their repos  
Challenge 3: Provide an OAuth login to allow users to view their private data  

This project was completed over a weekend and uses javascript and jQuery along
with Handlebars.js templates to populate the page and Bootstrap components for
layout and page elements. The page can be viewed live here http://dalevfenton.github.io/tiy-4.4-github-profile

This project also used a Node.js proxy server to allow OAuth calls to be made,
the repo for that server is at: https://github.com/dalevfenton/node-express-oauth-server
